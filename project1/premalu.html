    <p>Loved it. Full of energy characters with a good blend of comedy and emotion. Its characters, I'm sure will stay with the audience long after watching. I didn't help but fall for Sachin, well written character and Mamitha's character. Hilarious scenes here and there. The one where both Sachin and aadhi look at each other and scream (not knowing about each other's presence) at the birthday party was terrific. Amal Davis, the friend of Sachin oozes humour, their combo works wonders. I only wish Aadhi's character was better written. That's the only gripe for me. Nothing seemed over the top here and that's a great accomplishment for the movie team. The writers carefully add a serious subtext to these characters to make them feel real. While it's entirely subjective, i did fall for the lead pair. They were awesome.</p>
