        <p>Despite all its flaws, "Eagle" is a fairly fun and engaging watch. The movie may not work in its entirety, but some ideas are really good and deserve a theatrical experience. For someone who just doesn't enjoy action in Telugu cinema, I really loved a few blocks. Ravi Teja looks the best of all his recent movies.The bridge between great ideas and outstanding execution is experience. If this is where Karthik has landed after "Surya vs Surya," I'm sure he would do greater things going forward and hope he goes a long way!
