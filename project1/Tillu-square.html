    <p>Siddhu Jonnalagadda, as DJ Tillu, earned a special place in the hearts of audiences with his comedy timing and writing, allowing the makers to come up with its sequel, Tillu Square. The second installment is helmed by Mallik Ram, and Anupama Parameswaran played the leading lady. Amidst very good buzz, the movie has hit the screens today, and let’s see if it has lived up to the hype or not.With the huge amount earned, Tillu (Siddhu Jonnalagadda) becomes an event organizer. His attitude and style doesn’t change a bit and Tillu instantly falls in love with Lilly (Anupama Parameswaran). He starts wooing Lilly from the moment he sees her, and again, he lands in a huge mess. How Tillu comes out of it forms the crux of the story.
